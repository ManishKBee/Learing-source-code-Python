# Concept of variable and datatype

a="FluffyBee"
b=8281
c=69.69
d=None
e=input("entre the number:")
    # Printing the variable
print(a,b,c,d)
if d==10:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
    # Printing the type of variable
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))

'''Note: Python understand or consider the 
following datatypes by following symbol:
a. string is denoted by single, double or 
triple single quote quotes ("a" or 'a') 
python identifies this as class <str>
b. integer is denoted by writing any number 
without any quote or decimal point (123) 
python identifies this as class <int>
c. float are denoted by decimal point (1.1) 
python identifies this as class <float>
d. none datatype is used when we want no 
reshlts in return from the code 
python identifies this as class <none>
e. boolean is known for true and false logic 
which help us form statement having true or 
false as their outcome or result 
python identifies this as class <bool>'''
