print('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

''' Note: if we are using a string which
is longer than one line like the Poem than
we should use triple quote like used in this
comment or shown above in the code but use
use the function to execute as the triple
qoute used without any function becomes
multi-line comment (like this comment!!!)'''
