# tuples looks similar to list but the main differentiating factor is tuples are not updatable or changeable

# create tuples using () parentheses brackets

dot=() 
# empty tuple
print(dot)
# print tuple using print() function

dot1=(34,) 
# tuple with single item/element the wrong representing tuple with single element dot1=(34) without comma',' then python will consider it as a int value or a num
print(dot1)
# print tuple using print() function

dot2=(43,45,67,23,41,98) 
# tuple with more than one items or elements in it
print(dot2)
# print tuple using print() function

# dot1[0]=87 this will show error as we can't change the elements of the tuple
