# set in python are those data type which don't allow repeatative values

HiSet={1,2,3,4,5,1} 

print(HiSet) # as we have seen if print our set then the repaetative value of "1" is not priented angain in the second time

print(type(HiSet)) # default data type is "set"

# empty set Important 

# the below is for "empty Dictionary" not for "empty Set"
HeySet={} # this is not an empty set but it's an empty Dictionary 

print(type(HeySet)) # this will be of 'dict' <class> as it's an empty Dictionary

# correct syntax for 'empty set'
HelloSet=set() # this is the correct way to write or this is correct syntax for an empty set

print(type(HelloSet)) # this will the <class> as 'set' as it's an empty set

'''Note: "set data type" automatically sort 
the data in ascending order for the system'''
