# different methods/function in tuples

dot=(43,45,67,23,41,98,45,34,69,45,67,89,23,60,20,45)
print(dot.count(45))
# this will return the number of occurrences of a particular value which is asked like .count(34) then it will count the total num of occurrences of num "34" in the tuple

print(dot.index(45))
# this returns the index num of a specific num like if our tuple is (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,5,8,6,5) and we use .index(5) then python will return the indexed position of "num 5" which is "4" as the index starts with '0' and it will only show the first "occurrences of the indexed position" as we have seen in the example
